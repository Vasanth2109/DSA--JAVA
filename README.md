# DSA in Java

This repository contains my **daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java**.  
I am learning DSA step by step and organizing my solutions in a clear, topic-wise folder structure.

## 📌 Purpose
- Learn and understand core DSA concepts
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Build consistency through daily practice
- Maintain a structured GitHub repository for learning progress

## 🛠 Language Used
- Java

## 📂 Folder Structure
The code is organized topic-wise for easy navigation:

- Arrays
- Strings
- LinkedList
- Stack & Queue
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

Each folder contains Java files with problem solutions.

## 🧠 How I Write Solutions
- Clear and readable Java code
- Comments explaining the approach
- Focus on understanding rather than memorizing

## 🚀 Learning Status
This is an ongoing learning repository.  
I update it regularly as I practice new problems and concepts.
